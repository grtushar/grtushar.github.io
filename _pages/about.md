Every day, millions of people across Bangladesh tap their phones to send money, pay bills, and run their businesses — and I help make that happen. I'm Tushar, a Lead Software Engineer at [bKash Limited](https://bkash.com), the country's largest mobile financial service. I build the systems that keep digital payments fast, reliable, and secure at massive scale.

I grew up in Bangladesh, earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology](https://aust.edu) in 2015, and have been obsessed with building things that matter ever since. I care most about work that sits at the intersection of solid engineering and real-world impact — the kind where a well-placed optimization or a cleaner architecture quietly makes life easier for millions of people.
